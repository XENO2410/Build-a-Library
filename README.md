# Build-a-Library
The Library Management System is a JavaScript-based project that helps manage and organize a library's collection of books, CDs, and movies. This project uses classes and inheritance to create a structured system for media items with shared properties and methods. 

## Features
- Media Classes: The project defines a parent class, Media, and three subclasses: Book, CD, and Movie. These classes share common properties and methods.
- Book Class: Represents books in the library, including details like author, title, pages, and ratings.
- Movie Class: Represents movies with properties like director, title, runtime, and ratings.
- CD Class: Represents audio CDs with artist, title, songs, and ratings.
- Check-Out System: Each media item can be checked in or out, and its status can be toggled.
- Rating System: Users can rate media items, and the system calculates average ratings.
- Customizable: You can easily add more properties or methods to extend functionality.
